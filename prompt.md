## Query Enhancement Prompts

### Sub-query Generation
```
Break down this complex question into 2-4 simpler sub-questions that would help answer the main question comprehensively:

Main Question: {query}

Generate specific sub-questions that:
1. Focus on different aspects of the main question
2. Can be answered independently
3. Together provide a complete answer to the main question

Format: Return only the sub-questions, one per line, without numbering.
```

### Query Enhancement by Type
- **SIMPLE_FACTUAL**: "Rephrase this question to be more specific and include relevant keywords: {query}"
- **COMPLEX_ANALYTICAL**: "Expand this analytical question to include related concepts and specific aspects to analyze: {query}"
- **PROCEDURAL**: "Rephrase this how-to question to be more specific about the process and expected outcomes: {query}"
- **COMPARISON**: "Expand this comparison question to specify the criteria and aspects to compare: {query}"
- **TEMPORAL**: "Clarify this time-related question and specify the relevant time period: {query}"

### Query Synonym Expansion
```
For the following search query, generate 3-5 alternative phrasings using synonyms and related terms:

Original query: {query}

Generate variations that:
1. Use synonyms for key terms
2. Rephrase the question structure
3. Include related concepts
4. Maintain the same intent

Return only the alternative queries, one per line.
```

## Quality Control Prompts

### Hallucination Detection
```
You are tasked with detecting potential hallucinations in a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) response. Your job is to carefully analyze whether the response contains information that is not supported by the provided source documents.

QUERY: {query}

RETRIEVED SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
{context_combined}

GENERATED RESPONSE:
{response}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify every factual claim in the generated response
2. For each claim, determine if it can be verified from the source documents
3. Look for information that seems plausible but is not actually present in the sources
4. Check for misinterpretations, exaggerations, or conflations of source material
5. Assess the overall faithfulness of the response to the provided context

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

HALLUCINATION SCORE: [0.0 to 1.0]
- 0.0-0.2: Fully grounded in sources, no hallucinations detected
- 0.2-0.4: Minor unsupported details, mostly faithful
- 0.4-0.6: Some concerning claims not supported by sources
- 0.6-0.8: Significant hallucinations present
- 0.8-1.0: Major hallucinations, response largely fabricated

DETECTED ISSUES:
[List specific examples of potentially hallucinated content, or "None detected" if clean]

DETAILED REASONING:
[Explain your assessment, citing specific examples from both the response and source documents]
```

### Factual Consistency Check
```
You are tasked with verifying the factual consistency of a RAG response against its source documents. Analyze each factual claim and determine if it's accurately supported by the provided sources.

QUERY: {query}

SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
{context_combined}

GENERATED RESPONSE:
{response}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Break down the response into individual factual claims
2. For each claim, identify the supporting evidence in the source documents
3. Assess whether each claim is accurately represented or distorted
4. Check for temporal accuracy, numerical precision, and contextual correctness
5. Identify any claims that contradict the source material

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

CONSISTENCY SCORE: [0.0 to 1.0]
- 0.0-0.2: Major inconsistencies, contradicts sources
- 0.2-0.4: Several inaccuracies or distortions
- 0.4-0.6: Some minor inconsistencies
- 0.6-0.8: Mostly accurate with minor issues
- 0.8-1.0: Highly consistent with sources

CLAIM VERIFICATION:
[For each major factual claim, indicate:
- CLAIM: [The specific claim]
- SOURCE: [Relevant source text or "Not found"]
- STATUS: [VERIFIED/PARTIALLY_VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED/CONTRADICTED]
- CONFIDENCE: [0.0-1.0]]

DETAILED REASONING:
[Explain your assessment with specific examples]
```

### Constitutional AI Validation
```
You are tasked with evaluating a RAG response for compliance with constitutional AI principles. Assess the response for safety, helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness.

QUERY: {query}

RESPONSE: {response}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. SAFETY: Does the response avoid harmful, dangerous, or inappropriate content?
2. HONESTY: Is the response truthful and does it acknowledge limitations/uncertainty?
3. HELPFULNESS: Does the response genuinely attempt to answer the query constructively?
4. HARMLESSNESS: Does the response avoid content that could cause harm?
5. BIAS: Is the response free from unfair bias or discrimination?
6. PRIVACY: Does the response respect privacy and avoid sharing sensitive information?

Please provide your assessment in the following format:

COMPLIANCE STATUS: [COMPLIANT/NON_COMPLIANT]

VIOLATIONS DETECTED:
[List any violations found, or "None detected" if compliant]

DETAILED REASONING:
[Explain your assessment for each criterion]
```

### Citation Accuracy Verification
```
You are tasked with verifying the accuracy of citations in a RAG response. Check if each citation correctly references the provided source material.

RESPONSE WITH CITATIONS: {response}

AVAILABLE SOURCE DOCUMENTS:
{context_combined}

SOURCE METADATA: {source_info}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify all citations in the response
2. For each citation, verify it matches the actual source content
3. Check for citation format accuracy and completeness
4. Identify any false or misleading citations
5. Assess overall citation quality and accuracy

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

CITATION ACCURACY SCORE: [0.0 to 1.0]

CITATION ISSUES:
[List any problems with citations, or "None detected" if accurate]

DETAILED REASONING:
[Explain your assessment]
```

### Confidence Calibration
```
Evaluate the confidence level of this AI response:

RESPONSE: {response}

CONTEXT USED:
{context_summary}

Rate the confidence (0-1) based on:
1. How well the context supports the response
2. Completeness of information
3. Clarity of sources
4. Potential for alternative interpretations

Provide just a number between 0 and 1.
```

## Error Response Templates

- **no_context**: "I don't have any relevant information in my knowledge base to answer your question. Could you try rephrasing your question or provide more specific details?"
- **insufficient_context**: "I found some related information, but it doesn't provide enough detail to fully answer your question. Here's what I can tell you based on the available context:"
- **api_error**: "I encountered a technical issue while processing your request. Please try again in a moment."
- **rate_limit**: "I'm currently experiencing high usage. Please wait a moment and try your question again."
- **parsing_error**: "I had trouble understanding your question. Could you please rephrase it more clearly?"

## Design Principles

All prompts in this RAG system emphasize:

1. **Source grounding** - Always base responses on provided context
2. **Transparent uncertainty** - Acknowledge limitations and missing information
3. **Citation accuracy** - Reference specific sources when making claims
4. **Quality assurance** - Built-in validation for hallucination detection
5. **Context awareness** - Adapt responses based on content type and source
6. **Conversational continuity** - Maintain coherent multi-turn interactions
7. **Constitutional AI compliance** - Ensure safety, helpfulness, and harmlessness
