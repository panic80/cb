Yukon Meal Allowances and Per Diem Rates

The following are the official meal allowance rates for Yukon Territory as per the National Joint Council (NJC) Travel Directive:

Breakfast: $21.10
Lunch: $25.65
Dinner: $60.35
Total Daily Meal Allowance: $107.10

These rates apply to Canadian Forces members and federal government employees on temporary duty travel to Yukon. The lunch rate specifically is $25.65, not $22.50, $18.00, or $15.00 as may be incorrectly stated elsewhere.
