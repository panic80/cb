# Security Assessment Summary (Generated March 30, 2025)

This document summarizes the findings of a security assessment covering dependencies, server-side code, client-side code, and configuration/deployment artifacts.

## High Priority Issues

1.  **Critical API Key Exposure (Client-Side):** [RESOLVED]
    *   **Issue:** The Gemini API key (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`) is embedded in the client-side JavaScript bundle (`src/api/gemini.js`), allowing theft and misuse.
    *   **Remediation:** Immediately remove the key from client code. Route API calls through a secure backend proxy that handles the key server-side.

2.  **Critical Deployment Configuration (Running as Root):** [RESOLVED]
    *   **Issue:** Production deployment (`ecosystem.config.cjs`) runs the application as the `root` user, granting full server control upon exploit.
    *   **Remediation:** Immediately configure the application to run under a dedicated, non-privileged service user account.

3.  **High Risk of DOM XSS (Client-Side):** [PARTIALLY RESOLVED]
    *   **Issue:** `ChatbotWidget.jsx` renders API responses (Markdown, tables, links) without sufficient sanitization, risking XSS attacks via malicious API content.
    *   **Remediation:** Treat API data as untrusted. Implement server-side sanitization. Use secure client-side rendering (e.g., `ReactMarkdown` with sanitization plugin, validate links) and a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

4.  **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** [RESOLVED]
    *   **Issue:** Several dependencies (`axios`, `vite`, etc.) have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Remediation:** Run `npm audit fix` or manually update vulnerable packages as previously detailed.

## Other Significant Issues

*   **Server-Side:** Overly permissive CORS, missing rate limiting, potential prompt injection, risks from processing external content (DoS/SSRF), sensitive data exposure via logs/errors.
*   **Client-Side:** Potential exposure of OPI contact data, insecure dev API key handling, risks with client-side storage (IndexedDB) for sensitive data.
*   **Configuration & Deployment:** Inconsistent secrets management, insecure build process on production server, conflicting deployment procedures, documentation/configuration mismatches (e.g., HSTS), missing security headers, weak security linting rules.

## General Recommendations

1.  **Address Critical Issues Immediately:** Prioritize fixing the exposed API key, root user deployment, XSS vulnerability, and dependencies.
2.  **Standardize Practices:** Unify secrets management, deployment procedures (use CI/CD), and documentation.
3.  **Harden Server & Configuration:** Implement stricter CORS, rate limiting, input validation, secure logging, proper error handling, missing security headers, and run as non-privileged user.
4.  **Review & Sanitize Data Handling:** Treat external input/API responses as untrusted. Sanitize appropriately (server-side focus). Avoid storing sensitive data client-side.
5.  **Enhance Linting/Static Analysis:** Add security-specific linting rules and enforce stricter type safety.
