# API Integration Improvements

## Overview of Enhancements

This document summarizes the security and reliability improvements made to prepare the application for deployment to Hostinger VPS. These changes make the application more resilient, secure, and production-ready.

## 1. Security Improvements

### 1.1. API Key Handling
- Added secure API key validation
- Implemented header-based API key passing instead of query parameters
- Added key format validation to prevent misconfigurations
- Protected API keys from exposure in logs and error messages

### 1.2. Request Validation
- Added input validation for API requests
- Improved error handling for malformed requests
- Implemented content type checking

### 1.3. Rate Limiting
- Added client-based rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for retry logic
- Added proper 429 responses with Retry-After headers

## 2. Reliability Improvements

### 2.1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error classification and standardized error responses
- Added specialized error handling for common API failures
- Removed sensitive information from production error messages
- Implemented detailed error logging for debugging

### 2.2. Caching Mechanisms
- Enhanced multi-level caching strategy (memory + IndexedDB)
- Added proper HTTP caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified)
- Implemented stale-while-revalidate strategy for high availability
- Added data validation to prevent caching invalid responses

### 2.3. Fallback Content
- Added fallback content strategy for when API is unavailable
- Implemented graceful degradation patterns
- Added client-side fallback mechanism

## 3. Deployment Infrastructure

### 3.1. PM2 Configuration
- Enhanced PM2 configuration with better logging
- Added process monitoring and auto-restart capabilities
- Configured log rotation and error handling
- Added proper environment variable handling

### 3.2. Nginx Setup
- Added Nginx configuration with SSL and rate limiting
- Configured proxy settings for the dual-server architecture
- Implemented server-level rate limiting as a second defense
- Added proper HTTP headers for security

### 3.3. Monitoring
- Enhanced health check endpoint with detailed system status
- Added caching statistics for monitoring
- Improved logging for better diagnostics
- Added rate limiting statistics

## 4. Testing Improvements

### 4.1. Edge Case Testing
- Added tests for API key validation
- Implemented tests for rate limiting behavior
- Added fallback content tests
- Created security-focused test suite

### 4.2. Error Handling Tests
- Added tests for various error conditions
- Implemented retry logic tests
- Added tests for environment-specific behavior

## 5. Documentation

### 5.1. Deployment Guide
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Added troubleshooting section
- Documented Nginx configuration
- Added security best practices

### 5.2. Environment Configuration
- Added environment configuration documentation
- Documented required environment variables
- Added staging and production environment setups
