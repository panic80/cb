# Chatbot Testing Report (MVP)

## Overview

This document outlines the testing plan and identified potential issues for the AI Chatbot MVP implementation. This review is based on the following sources:
- Requirements: `docs/chatbot-requirements.md`
- Architecture: `docs/chatbot-architecture.md`
- Code reviews:
    - RAG service: `server/services/ragService.js`
    - API integration: `server/main.js`
    - Frontend Chatbot Widget: `src/components/ChatbotWidget.jsx`
    - Frontend Integration: `src/App.jsx`

## Setup Verification

- **GEMINI_API_KEY**:
  - Current documentation does not clearly specify how to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY`. No explicit instructions in the README or `.env.example` file have been found.
  - This may lead to confusion during setup and local testing.

## Execution (Simulated)

Follow these steps to run the project locally:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Alternatively, if needed, manually start the server: `node server/main.js`
4. Ensure that the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set as required.

## Testing Plan

- **Basic Functionality Tests:**
  - Test greeting messages to ensure the chatbot responds.
  - Test questions relevant to the Canada.ca content to verify if the RAG service returns accurate and relevant responses.
  - Verify the frontend widget's functionality for sending messages and displaying responses.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Simulate missing or invalid `GEMINI_API_KEY` to check error handling and fallback mechanisms.
  - Test network or API failures to observe logging and error messaging on both frontend and backend.

## Identified Issues & Diagnosis

Several potential issues and diagnostic points have been identified:
1. **GEMINI_API_KEY Setup:**
   - Potential issue: Instructions for setting `GEMINI_API_KEY` are unclear or missing.
   - Diagnostic logs recommendation: Check error logs in the server console for missing key errors.
2. **RAG Service Error Handling:**
   - Potential issue: Insufficient error handling or logging if the RAG service fails (e.g. network/API issues).
   - Diagnostic logs recommendation: Add logging to capture error responses from the Gemini API.
3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Potential issue: The UI may not properly display failure messages or loading indicators.
   - Diagnostic logs recommendation: Inspect browser console logs for errors during interaction.
4. **API and Data Flow:**
   - Potential issue: Mismatch between expected API responses and frontend parsing might cause UI inconsistencies.
   - Diagnostic logs recommendation: Validate response payloads and verify integration between `ragService.js` and `server/main.js`.

**Most Likely Sources of Issues:**
- GEMINI_API_KEY configuration not properly documented.
- Insufficient logging and error handling in the RAG service.

*Please review and confirm if these diagnoses and logs recommendations match your observations before proceeding with any fixes.*

## Conclusion

This report outlines the testing plan and identifies potential areas for improvement in the MVP AI Chatbot implementation. The next steps include verifying these issues via logs and further validation with actual deployments.
