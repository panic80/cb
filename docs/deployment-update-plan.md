# Deployment Update Plan: Incorporate Domain into deploy.md

**Objective:** Update `deploy.md` to include the domain `https://32cbgg8.com` for verification purposes within the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Analysis:**

*   The file `deploy.md` was reviewed.
*   No standard domain placeholders (e.g., `your-domain.com`) were found.
*   The most suitable location for adding the domain is the optional "Verify Deployment" step in the GitHub Actions example (lines 124-126).

**Approved Plan:**

1.  **Target:** Modify the `- name: Verify Deployment (Optional)` step within the GitHub Actions workflow example in `deploy.md`.
2.  **Action:** Replace the current placeholder `run` command on line 126 (`run: echo "Deployment script executed."`) with a more concrete verification step using `curl`.
3.  **Content to Insert:** The new `run` block will check if the domain `https://32cbgg8.com` is accessible after deployment.
    ```yaml
          run: |
            echo "Attempting to verify deployment at https://32cbgg8.com ..."
            curl -sSf https://32cbgg8.com || (echo "Verification failed!" && exit 1)
            echo "Verification successful!"
    ```
4.  **Tool for Implementation:** `search_and_replace` will be used in Code mode to replace the content of line 126 in `deploy.md` with the new multi-line `run` block content.
